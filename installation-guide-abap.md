## Import the Kernseife ATC Check into target system (using [abapGit](https://github.com/abapGit/abapGit))
Run the standalone version of abapGit using transaction `ZABAPGIT` or executing the report in ZABAPGIT_STANDALONE.

You can find the lastest version of the standalone report here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abapGit/build/main/zabapgit_standalone.prog.abap

In abapGit click on "New Offline" to add a new repository. Enter the repo name KERNSEIFE and create a new package $KERNSEIFE and click on "Create Offline Repository".

After the .zip was imported you need to press "Pull". This opens a dialog where you have to confirm the objects to be imported. 
If you used the Package name starting with $, it will be a Local Package and no transport is needed.
Otherwise you need a Workbench Transport Request.
As we normally don't want to run code-checks in Quality or Production, we recommend using a Local Package.

## Enable Kernseife Check Variant for ATC
After importing the the repository and creating the configuration files, the ATC check must be imported in ABAP Code inspector.
Open Transaction `SCI` (Code Inspector) and click in the top bar on Utilities => "Import Check Variants"

The checks for Kernseife should now appear in this list.
First you need to select the Category (ZKNSF_CL_CI_CATEGORY) and save.
Afterwards you can select the Check (ZKNSF_CL_API_USAGE) and save.
This requires a Workbench Request which can be deleted afterwards, in case you don't want to transport the Checks downstream.

## Upload Classification Json
Execute Report ZKNSF_CLASSIFICATION_MANAGR
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/07e5d511-1d64-4edf-a83a-4d8b2f3f05a0)

Click on "Upload Classic API File".
Select the Classification Json File.



## Create Check Variant

Go to Transaction SCI and create a new check variant.
We recommend to copy the standard variant ABAP_CLOUD_DEVELOPMENT_3TIER as a base.
Make sure the new Variant is a public one and not a personal one.

If you used ABAP_CLOUD_DEVELOPMENT_3TIER, you should
Disable the "Usage of Released APIs" Check.
Enable the "Check for Enhancement Technology".

In every case you need to activate the "Kernseife: Usage of APIs" Check.
